        <p>I am <strong>AVAILABLE</strong> for permanent job opportunities
        starting Jan 2020. I'm happy to work anywhere in Zone 1/Zone 2 (or further out if it's South London), but will consider roles elsewhere
        if I love the sound of them!<br></br> <em>(If you have an office dog, this may or may not factor in...)</em></p>
        <p>Want to know when I'm on the lookout for jobs? Enter your email below and I'll keep you in the loop!</p>
